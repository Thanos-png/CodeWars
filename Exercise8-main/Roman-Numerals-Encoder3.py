# As the previous solution this is not mine but i really like it because of how sort it is

# Solution:

units = " I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX".split(" ")
tens = " X XX XXX XL L LX LXX LXXX XC".split(" ")
hundreds = " C CC CCC CD D DC DCC DCCC CM".split(" ")
thousands = " M MM MMM".split(" ")

def solution(n):
    return thousands[n//1000] + hundreds[n%1000//100] + tens[n%100//10] + units[n%10]
