### Find the odd int(6kyu)



### Case:
###### Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
###### There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

### Examples:
``` [7] ``` should return ``` 7 ``` , because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
``` [0] ``` should return ``` 0 ``` , because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
``` [1,1,2] ``` should return ``` 2 ``` , because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
``` [0,1,0,1,0] ``` should return ``` 0 ``` , because it occurs 3 time (which is odd).  
``` [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] ``` should return ``` 4 ``` , because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
